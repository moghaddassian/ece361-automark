# Example: Analyzing CSV Data w/ Error Bounds
Uses Python to parse and analyze CSV data.

Check's the student's data and allows it to be within bounds of a reference data file (also in CSV format).

**NOTE:** This is for a case where the student submits raw data. Thus, the `test` executable will simply just check if their submission exists and print out its contents.
