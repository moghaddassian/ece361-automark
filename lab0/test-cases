# If line starts with 'public', then the case following the comma
# will be used as part of the public exerciser tests.
# If line starts with 'private', the case following the comma will
# be used as part of the private (marked) set of tests.
#
# Format:
#   <public or private> <case/dir name> [mark, if private]
#
# NOTES:
#   - Case names are also the names of the directories where the
#     tester will look in to find the test files.
#   - Marks must be positive numbers. They can be in decimal format,
#     but if so, they must begin and end with an integer.
#       - e.g. 0.5 is valid, .5 is not valid
#       - e.g. 2.0 is valid, 2. is not valid
